                <p class="question">Why is the man directing traffic so grumpy?</p>
                <p class="answer">We'll let you choose your own adventure for this answer!</p>
                <ol class="answer">
                  <li>You did something rude (like cut the line)</li>
                  <li>It's a really hot (or cold) day and the grumpy man has been directing traffic for the last 8 hours (we're not complaining, but you can see how one could get grumpy standing in the same hot spot of pavement with the sun beating down for hours) or</li>
                  <li>(Probably the most likely answer for this particular question) He was just born that way. Just as Eyore always has a rain cloud hanging over him or that old lady next door always has to yell when you step on her lawn, our traffic directors were born with the grumpy jean! Please don't take it personally, just have some fun with it and and scowl back!</li>
